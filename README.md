# Picture API

I wanted to build a website(or any other client with User Interface) and web service that will have 
- Users `login`/`register`
- Uploading and showing images. 
- Require `Username(email)` and `Password` parameters for the login 
- Detail for images: `Title` and `Description`. 
- The website should show all the images that users `uploaded` and `sort by date of upload` Ascending(`asc`) and Descending(`desc`). And thatâ€™s it. 
- The website should display them somehow allowing us to `change the sorting`. 
- Also the important part is that Api should not allow posting images to `api` without `authentication`. 


## Project setup

1. Install `nodejs` if you don't have it installed ( check it in the `terminal`, type `$ node -v` or `$ npm -v`)
2. Clone the project from the terminal (type `$ git clone https://github.com/VianneyR4/Picture_api.git`) or you can download a ZIP file
3. Then open the main directory of the project then type in the `terminal` the below cmd

```
npm install
```

## Database setup

1. Go in phpmyadmin (make sure that your server is on. you can use 'MAMP', 'XAMPP', ...)
2. Create a Database with any name
3. Import the file `ujatcare_test_db.sql` ( path: `./db/ujatcare_test_db.sql`) in the Databese you created
4. Open the file `config.js` ( path: `./config/config.json`) and put informations of the Databese you created

    ```
    "username": "root", // your db username by default is 'root' ...
    "password": "root", // your db password by default is ' '(empty) and for MAMP is 'root' ...
    "database": "ujatcare_test_db", // name of the db you created ...
    "host": "127.0.0.1", // leave it like this if you're in local ...
    "dialect": "mysql", // leave this too, is the type of db used ...
    "port": "8889" // put the port of you db server (this is by default for MAMP) ...
    ```

    Note: for more precision give the same config for `developement`, `test`, and `production`.

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development server

1. Go back again in the `terminal` and type the below cmd to run the `API Server`

```
npm start
```
